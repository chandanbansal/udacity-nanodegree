In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "* In my opinion lower `'LSTAT'` should add more value to `'MEDV'`. Lower `'LSTAT'` would increase the Rich people percentage in the neighborhood, that can affect the lifestyle of area. \n",
    "* As per my intuition lower `'PTRATIO'` can have few reasons: \n",
    "    * The population of society is low and schools have teachers from outside the locality. This can either effect on value of `'MEDV'`, we need a balance in this case.\n",
    "    * Locality have less number of young people as compare to elders. This can decrease the value of `'MEDV'`. \n",
    "    * International schools usually have lower `'PTRATIO'` or locality have more schools. That means more facilities in the locality and can increase the value of `'MEDV'`."

    "* Graph with max_depth of 3.\n",
    "* Initially training curve was very close to `1` and testing curve was close to `0`. Which shows the high variance and the model was overfitting. But as we added more points, both curve came close as the model was able to adust. Now score are somewhere b/w `7-8` and variance is very less, which seems to best fitting scenario. \n",
    "* In this case we can clearly see that the curve has converged to its optimal score. Hence i believe more training points will not help here.\n"

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* Cross validation is used to validate the performance of model. It will helps us to see how the model is generalising on an independent data set. K-fold is common type of the cross validation technique used in machine learning. **K-fold** cross validation follow below mentioned steps:\n",
    "    * Partition the **training** dataset into k groups called folds of equal sizes. \n",
    "    * Train model using **k-1 folds** and **validate** the performance on remaining 1 fold.\n",
    "    *  We can use this technique **k times** and each time use different cross-validation bucket, also make sure to discard the model.\n",
    "    * The **average** of performance scores calculated from k cases, is used to estimate the performance of the model. \n",
    "    * Once we select the best parameters using k-fold, we will use the **test set** to check the **final performance** of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Grid search we manually give multiple hyper-parameters and again tweak them. We do it until model doesn't perform. This is like leaking the **test** set into model or our model will get **biased** toward the test set. To solve this we need a cross validation layer. Hence we divide training set into 2 sets and introduce one more set called **validation set**. We iteratively tune our model based on training and validation set. Once the model experiment is finalised and validated, final evaluation is done on test data. But now by partitioning the whole data into 3 sets we reduced the number of samples for training. Hence the **f-fold** help here.\n"

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.20/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.model_selection` to create a grid search object.\n",
